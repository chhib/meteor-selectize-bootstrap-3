# Selectize v0.12.1

[Selectize](http://brianreavis.github.io/selectize.js/) is the hybrid of a textbox and `<select>` element. It's a jQuery-based plugin that can be used for tagging, contact lists, country selectors, and lots more.

## Install

`meteor add chhib:selectize-bootstrap-3`

This Meteor package loads the plugin and adds the Bootstrap 3 stylesheet.  Just add to your app and set it up manually as you would in any other application.
